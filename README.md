## How it works
-- Works on decentralized TCP sockets client-server architecture with devices connected over same Wifi LAN or mobile hotspot. 
-- Every device can act as a host server or client to a host server or both at the same time for connecting to 2 different clients/hosts.
-- This decentralization allows transmission and receive of files both at same time through multiple clients/hosts.
-- 2 channel socket communication to receive and transfer data simultaneously
-- It requires permission for managing external storage to perform read/write operations to the system.
-- developed with MVVM + Repository architecture
